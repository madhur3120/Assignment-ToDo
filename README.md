# TaskTrail 
A kanban web application for productivity and management built on react.js

## To Run

## Features
- **Users**: Create individual accounts to manage your tasks and boards.
- **Boards**: As a user, you can create multiple boards to manage different sets of tasks.
- **Customizable Boards**: Every board is flexible. Instead of being restricted to traditional stages like "Open", "In Progress", and "Done", you can customize the stages of your task board to your preference, for example "Read", "Working", "Reviewing", and "Completed".
- **Tasks**: Within every stage, create individual tasks.
- **Drag & Drop Functionality**: Tasks can be dragged and dropped within the same stage or moved across different stages seamlessly.

## Adding and Removing Tasks
- Navigate to your desired board.
- Click on the "Edit Stages" button.
- Here, you can add new stages, edit the name of existing ones, or delete stages.
- Once done, save changes and your board will reflect the new stages.
